         <p>    Alex started school at the University of California, Davis in fall 2013 and began working as a Research Assistant in the chemistry department under Kirill Kovnir shortly afterwards. Taking an internship at the Sustainability and Nutrition Office in spring 2015, he left the chemistry department to work as a Farmers Market Marketing Intern after which he had a summer internship at EM&N8 Controllers working as a Hardware Engineer.
         </p><p>
             Finding his niche after 2 years of exploration he accepted a job tutoring Physics and Mathematics in fall 2015 while simultaneously starting work as an Undergraduate Research Associate for the millimeter-wave laboratory studying Applied Electromagnetics and high frequency circuits. In spring 2016 he acquired two more jobs; first an Astronomy Laboratory helper in the Physics department, and second a first year aggie connections peer mentor. 
         </p><p>     
        Summer 2016 Alex worked at the California Energy Commission as an Energy Analyst where he learned about jobs with the state. In the fall he found that balancing all 5 jobs (for a total of up to 39 hours/week) was a bit much as an honors engineering student, which led to his resignation from the tutoring and roof helping positions while the work for the research position began to wind down. After spring 2017 Alex was selected to represent UC Davis at several conferences and spent some of his summer volunteering as a counselor at a summer camp for foster youth.
         </p><p>
Beginning school again this fall Alex hopes to finish his degree by spring 2018. He aspires to start a business and move past the early fundraising stages in school to realize his dream of working for himself upon graduation. In his spare time Alex enjoys competing in the UC Davis Cross Country and Track Club team as well as playing Intramural Soccer and Frisbee. With friends he rock climbs and hikes, in addition to stargazing when conditions allow. His free time is spent programing smartphone games and applications, writing, animating, dancing, and learning about the world.
