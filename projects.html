        <h2>Candar: the RF Radar Design Project</h2>
        <img class="size" src="Images/Candar.jpg">
<div class="parchment"> 
         <p>Sponsored by the UC Davis Electrical and Computer Engineering's Adaptive RF Technology group project consisted of building a radar system from scratch</p>
        <p>For my senior design project I worked with a group of 3 other Engineering students to build (from the ground up) a radar system over the course of the academic year, culminating in a competition for radar preformance. Full details and the technical report can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7WII0S2pZAMbGpiQlBvLUV3eklFRWtDa2FxR2Fmd2VQUTNZ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

        <h2>EE Emerge</h2>
  
        <img class="size" src="Images/EE%20Emerge.jpg">      
<div class="parchment">
         <p>Sponsored by Texas Instruments this design project program admitted only 20 sophmore and junior students in the college of engineering to form 3 teams. Our project was presented at numerous venues such as UC Davis' Picnic Day, Industrial Affiliates, Senior Design Showcase, and Maker Fair.</p>
        <p>Worked collaboratively in a group with other engineering students to develop a project that engaged audiences with the auditory and visual senses. Motivated children and young adults to pursue careers in STEM fields by getting them excited about technology and what can be created. Showcased knowledge gained in program by presenting project at numerous local and national events. Prepared technical paper and report of project goals, scopes and accomplishments.</p>
        <p>A copy of the final report can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iErrH-nxPAVTV0SklG41UIhTu6dCzdjFpYmYseOIBe4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and an image gallery of pictures taken at Picnic Day can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7WII0S2pZAMRWxYRWd1SlBXOHM?usp=sharing">here.</a> There are also videos of our project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwxEV5YhVXGSZHZ5eGJOWTUzX3c/view?usp=sharing">mirror</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwxEV5YhVXGSWkxOZXo2UDItQ00/view?usp=sharing">box</a>.</p>
